# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

**Only the latest version are supported.**

If you use a version that is not the latest, I highly recommend you update to the latest version.
Otherwise, you are on your own.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report a vulnerability by opening an [issue](https://github.com/jhdcruz/kipher/issues/new/choose),
or, if you think the vulnerability is very sensitive, you
can [submit a security advisory](https://github.com/jhdcruz/kipher/security/advisories/new) in the security tab.

**Reporting a vulnerability should at least include the following:**

- A description of the vulnerability
- How to reproduce the vulnerability/proof-of-concept (very important)
- Possible ways to fix/mitigate the vulnerability _(optional)_
- Any references/sources _(optional)_
